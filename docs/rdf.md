## RDF canonical URL

Due to historical reasons, the canonical URL for the legal tools in RDF uses
the HTTP (unencrypted) protocol.

Although the legal tools are not available via HTTP, the URLs still function
correctly due to redirects. Additionally, the RDF now includes an `owl:sameAs`
element with the HTTPS URL for further compatibility.

For example:

| Context | Protocol | Canonical URL | Published data example |
| ------- | -------- | ------------: | ---------------------- |
| RDF | HTTP | `http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/` | [licenses/by/4.0/rdf#L3][ex1]
| all other uses | HTTPS | `https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/` | [licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en.html#L390-L397][ex2]

## Changes


### Overview

The changes between the old legacy ccEngine RDF/XML and the new CC Legal Tools
App  RDF/XML aim to enhance clarity, accuracy, compatibility, and
standardization of the RDF representation of Creative Commons licenses.  The
improvements enhance the machine-readability and semantic understanding of the
licenses, enabling better integration and interpretation within digital
ecosystems. A general overview of what and why changes occured:


#### Improved Structure and Consistency

- What: The structure of the RDF/XML files has been improved for better
  clarity, consistency, and adherence to RDF standards.
- Why: A well-defined and consistent structure makes it easier for machines to
  process and interpret the RDF data accurately.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML have a more organized and standardized
  structure compared to the older legacy RDF/XML, ensuring that elements and
  properties are consistently represented.


#### Updated License Information

- What: License information and conditions have been updated for some of the
  licenses.
- Why: Keeping license information up-to-date ensures that users and automated
  systems are aware of the current permissions and restrictions associated with
  the licenses.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML include the most recent and updated license
  Information.


#### Alignment with RDF Best Practices

- What: Changes have been made to align the RDF/XML representation with best
  practices and recommendations in the RDF.
- Why: Following best practices ensures that the RDF data is structured in a
  way that maximizes interoperability and compatibility with other
  RDF-consuming applications.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML adhere to established RDF conventions, such
  as using standardized namespaces, consistent naming conventions, and properly
  defined relationships.


### 2023-09-08 Added machine layer to (this) CC Legal Tools App

Fixed wrong `cc:deprecatedOn` on the following legal tools:

- CC Sampling+ 1.0 DE
- CC Sampling+ 1.0 TW
- CC Sampling+ 1.0

Updated RDF namespace prefix:
- `dcterms` replaced ~~`dc`~~ and ~~`dcq`~~

Added missing license RDF/XML:
- CC BY-NC-ND 2.1 CA
- CC BY-NC-SA 2.1 CA
- CC BY-NC 2.1 CA
- CC BY-ND 2.1 CA
- CC BY 2.1 CA
- CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 AM
- CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AM
- CC BY-NC 3.0 AM

Removed legacy ccEngine RDF/XML for nonexistent license:
- ~~CC BY-ND-NC 2.0 JP~~

Improved compatibility:
- Added additional [DCMI: DCMI Metadata Terms][dcmiterms] to RDF/XML:
  - `dcterms:LicenseDocument` (duplicates `cc:legalcode`)
  - `dcterms:Jurisdiction` with
    `rdf:datatype="http://purl.org/dc/terms/ISO3166"` (duplicates
    `cc:jurisdiction` except for `igo` which uses `un` and for `scotland` for
    which this element is omitted)
    - Also see [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia][wp3166alpha2]
- Added `owl:sameAs` element with HTTPS URL

Improved multilingual support:
- Title translations now match legal code (removed title translation languages
  that the legal code has not yet been translated into)
- Added `xml:lang` to `cc:legalcode`
- Removed top level ~~`rdf:Description`~~ elements that were redundant with
  `cc:legalcode` and `dcterms:LicenseDocument` elements

Removed third-party license RDF/XML (the deeds and legal codes were replaced by
redirects long ago):
- ~~`/licenses/BSD/rdf`~~
- ~~`/licenses/GPL/2.0/rdf`~~
- ~~`/licenses/LGPL/2.1/rdf`~~
- ~~`/licenses/MIT/rdf`~~
- ~~`/licenses/by-nd-nc/2.0/jp/rdf`~~
